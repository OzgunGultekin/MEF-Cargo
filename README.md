## Materials

- Python
- Python Tkinter
- MySQL

## Project Functions
**Cargo Management and Tracking:** The user can see the status of his cargo. For example, by entering the cargo ID code, the user can see what condition the cargo is in and at which distribution center it is.

**Employee Management System:**  Admins can add the employee as staff or couriers to the destination centers and branches with this application. Also, admin and employee permissions are separated into different menus because of privacy and security conditions.  Employees can add cargo, customers and create bills.

**Customer System:** Users encounter two options within the application. First of all, they can track their cargo with their cargo ID without registering with the system. The other option is to sign up to the system and see their past cargoes, their information, and invoices for their past cargoes.

**Billing System:** Each cargo must have its invoice. The invoice includes the date of the invoice, the fee, the ID of the cargo, and the ID of the person sending the cargo. These invoices are entered into the system by employees.

**Distribution Center System:** Distribution Centers, which have a crucial place in cargo distribution, are controlled by the Admin System in the project. Distribution centers can be added to the system by the Admin, and the admin can also add employees to that distribution center.

**Logging System:** After the cargo is delivered to the branch, employees enter a log into the system for each step it takes. First of all, when the branch receives the cargo, the system automatically creates the first Log specific to that cargo ID. In each subsequent step, employees update the Log with their IDs.
